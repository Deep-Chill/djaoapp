It is impossible to add comments into a json file and the yaml parser
used by Django is broken for utc dates. We resort to put the description
of fixtures here - less than ideal.

default-db.json
    Donny (username: donny, password: yoyo) is a manager for the broker (i.e.
    hosting site).
    Alice (username: alice, password: yoyo) is a manager for a provider.
    Xia (username: xia, password: yoyo) has one subscription to a plan.

cowork-db.json
    Separate database to test multitier databases.

- test coupons:
    DIS100: 100% discount

130-subscriptions.json
    Defines a provider a 2 plans and 5 subscribers such that each subscription
    period intersects [2022-04-01,2022-07-31[ in a different way.
    This fixture is used to test active, all and churned subscriptions APIs.
